PyMUSH is a nifty little MUSH server written in Python!A MUSH is a text based multi-player adventure type game. Generally a MUSH giveslogged in users the ability to change and alter their world by creating Rooms,Objects and Exits. MUSHes have their own internal scripting language that givesusers the ability to create diverse and immersive games from inside the world.This is a server I started writing when I was first learning Python. I've alwaysenjoyed hacking on MUSHes in C, so why not?Currently it's fairly limited. The world doesn't persist betweenshutdowns/reboots and the command list is fairly limited. The internal langaugeis far from complete with only a few functions defined so far. The languageparser does work though.One unique aspect of this server is that it's not based on TCP/IP connectionslike a standard MUSH. Instead it's based on WebSockets with a browser based WebClient. The Webocket server is handled with Tornado.Tha Python server exists in /src, and the Web Client (far from done, mostly aprototype to make it work) exists in www.The biggest advantage to the web based client is that we aren't limited to thestandard text based interfaces that exist via a Telnet style client in a noramlMUSH. With a web client we can build rich interactive interfaces thatautoupdate and support other protocols, like showing images and sounds.
